### User Experience Developer · Project Manager · Computer Science Student  
#### Focused on AI-driven systems, scalable interfaces, and technical leadership

I am a User Experience Developer with an engineering mindset and a Project Manager in the telecommunications and AI space. My work sits at the intersection of frontend development and product design, with a strong emphasis on building clear, usable, and scalable software.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cis.fiu.edu/degree/b-a-computer-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Florida International University (FIU)</a>, where my academic focus is on software engineering fundamentals, algorithms, and AI-oriented interfaces.

In parallel, I work as a Project Manager at <a href="https://www.fibextelecom.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibex Telecom</a>, a leading ISP in Latin America. In this role, I:

- Lead AI-driven and cloud-based software initiatives (ERP, CRM, eCommerce, automation tools)
- Coordinate cross-functional teams and international development partners
- Translate business and operational needs into technical requirements and delivery plans
- Apply Agile methodologies and use tools like Microsoft Planner, Teams, and modern AI copilots to drive execution
- Focus on process clarity, documentation, and measurable outcomes

My background includes frontend development (React, TypeScript, Next.js, animations, and design systems), UX/UI design, and a growing specialization in AI-enabled products and technical project leadership. I care deeply about teamwork, maintainable code, thoughtful interfaces, and long-term system design.
